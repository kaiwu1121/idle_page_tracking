Idle Page Tracking
==================

This is a toolbox for idle page tracking.  It can be used to know real working
set size of a process.


Tools
=====

This section gives brief description and usage of each tool in box.


userprog
--------

`userprog` is a sample synthetic workload for test of other tools.  It
interactively allocates and access specified pages in the allocated pages.
After execution, it first asks how many pages to allocates.  Once you type in
how many pages to allocate, the program will repeatedly asks how many pages in
the allocated pages you want to do access.


heapof.py
---------

`heapof.py` receives pid as argument and print out virtual address range for
heap of the process.  Internally, it uses /proc/pid/maps file.  For example,
you may use the tool as below:
```
$ ./heapof.py `pidof userprog`
0x00dfb000-0x00e1c000
```


pfnof.py
--------

`pfnof.py` receives pid and virtual address range as argument and giving page
frame number for the virtual address range.  Output of `heapof.py` can be used
as the argument for virtual address range.  Internally, it uses
/proc/pid/pagemap.  Because of security, you should have root access.  For
example, you may use the tool in below way:
```
# PID=`pidof userprog`; HEAP=`./heapof.py $PID`; sudo ./pfnof.py $PID $HEAP
100156099
35988272
45393716
39988623
39988620
42619059
37091435
42283669
47752799
47576225
40606338
```


pageidle
--------

`pageidle` is a program to set / get idleness of physical pages.  When running
it, you should give at least 2 arguments.  First argument should be string,
`set` or `get`.  After that, page frame number(s) of physical page(s) that you
want to set or get their idleness should follow.  For example:
```
$ PID=`pidof userprog`; HEAP=`./heapof.py $PID`; \
	PFNS=`sudo ./pfnof.py $PID $HEAP`; sudo ./pageidle set $PFNS
$ PID=`pidof userprog`; HEAP=`./heapof.py $PID`; \
	PFNS=`sudo ./pfnof.py $PID $HEAP`; sudo ./pageidle get $PFNS
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

After you access few pages using `userprog`, the output of `get` becomes
different.
```
/* From userprog */
How many pages you want to access? 3
will access 3 pages
How many pages you want to access?

/* From other terminal */
$ PID=`pidof userprog`; HEAP=`./heapof.py $PID`; \
	PFNS=`sudo ./pfnof.py $PID $HEAP`; sudo ./pageidle get $PFNS
0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
